                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I’m Pip! I’ve been working In the makeup industry for 11 years as a MUA and have gained behind-the-scenes experience in TV and Film makeup but now specialise in bridal makeup.   
                     More recently in 2019, I switched to cruelty free makeup kit so my clients can still enjoy the luxury of makeup, safe in the knowledge that they are not using products that are tested on animals.</p>
                    <p>I live in South East Wales with my husband and two dogs Pebbles and Teddy.  I am able to travel easily to venues throughout Wales and also have great access to the South of England and the Midlands.</p>
                    <p>I will work with you to create a flawless look that is a true reflection of your personality and enhances your natural beauty so that you’re still <strong><em>you</em></strong> on your wedding day but with that extra bridal glow.</p>
                        <p>Take a look at my <a href="gallery.html" class="gallery-link">gallery</a> to see some examples of the beautiful brides I have had the pleasure of working with.</p>

                    <h4>Makeup Trial</h4>

                    I will also consult you on your skin type so I can tailor the products to your individual needs.  The makeup trial usually last an hour for a Bride and 30-45 minutes for a Mother of the Bride/Groom and/or Bridesmaid.</p>
                    <p>We will also discuss your requirements on the day of the wedding such as additional services - refresh and/or evening makeup look.</p>

                    <h4>Wedding Day</h4>
                    <p>You can relax and leave your makeup schedule to me.</p>
                    <p>I will arrive at your venue, accommodation or home 30 minutes prior to starting makeup to set up my kit and will provide you with a breakdown of timings to ensure that you and your wedding party are looking fabulous and ready to walk down the aisle with time to spare to toast your new future.</p>
