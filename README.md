## Credits
----

* I used very similar code for my home page, nav bar and footer as taught in the 'Love Running Walkthrough Project' on the [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Web Development course.  I did change some styling , but ultimately I was aiming for a simliar layout for my main page and navigation links/footer and this code helped me to get my project off to a good start.

* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) has been an invaluable resource and I have read many articles relating to positioning, styling my contact form (which gave me a bit of headache to be honest!!)

* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Again a valuable resource for consolidating what I had already learned and finding out more about HTML and CSS properties.

* [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) - I used this website to select a color pallete, I started with a natural dark brown similar to that of the wood in the banner image and used that to generate a pallette of complementing colors.  From a selection of palettes generated, I chose the 'Classy Palette'

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 

* [Google](http://google.com)

* [Online Convert](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-webp) - used to convert images from jpeg to webp for better performance

* Pip Southgate - for providing all images and content for the website (permissions receieved from any wedding photographers and former-clients to use images).
