## Design
----

The site owner wanted a classic style to the website.  We initially decided on a color scheme incorporating natural tones of subtle pinks and greens and that colour pallete was selected using [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/), but during the build I felt that the colour scheme distracted from the imagery and after checking the colour pallete using [EigthShapes Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23F2F2F2%0D%0A%23DDDDDD%0D%0A%23CCCCCC%0D%0A%23888888%0D%0A%23404040%2C%20Charcoal%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%232F78C5%2C%20Effective%20on%20Extremes%0D%0A%230F60B6%2C%20Effective%20on%20Lights%0D%0A%23398EEA%2C%20Ineffective%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) I realised it was not great in terms of contrast/accessibility.  After some discussion with the site owner, we decided to go with a more sleek and simple design.  We chose a simple two colour palette of a dark leafy green, similar to that in the head-dress worn by the client in the hero-image, and this is used in contrast with an off-white.  This colour combination gives the highest rating in compliance with [WCAG 2.0 minimum contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) for text/background.  

![Contrast Grid](assets/images/contrast-grid.png)

All of the images used throughout the site have been provided by Pip Southgate and are images of her former clients.  Permission has been given from the clients and photographers - where the photos have not been taken by Pip herself - to use the images on her website and social media pages.  The images on the 'thank-you' page and '404 error page' were sourced from Pexels and photographer credits have been included beneath each. 

Google Fonts was used to select a classy and stylish looking font for the main logo and headings - 'Poiret One' and this was paired with the widely used 'Raleway' for the main content.  A third font was used on the thank-you page only - this was used to give a more handwritten, personal style to the sign-off of the thank-you message.  The font used here was 'Indie Flower'.

### Existing Features

* Navigation Menu 
    - This features on all pages of the website.  The position and style is consistent across all pages to allow the user to intuitively navigate each page of the website.  The navigation menu also has an active class applied so the user can easily see which page they are currently on as the associated link will be marked with a bottom border.

* Footer 
    - Social Media Links to Facebook and Instagram to allow the user to stay connected to the make-up artist and see regular posts.
    - Telephone number and email address in footer on each page.  This means that the user does not have to navigate to a different page to have access to this information if they decide they want to email or telephone.

* Home Page Features
    - The Hero-image is high quality photograph of former client of Pip Southgate on her weddig day.  The image is quite striking with the contrast between the bright orange hair of the client and the natural tones in her headress. This image as it showcases the natural style Pip Southgate has with her makeup application
    - There is a text overlay box which briefly summarises the areas covered by the MUA, but leaves out enough information to entice the site user to make an enquiry.
    - There is also a contact button within the text overlay box which links directly to the contact page.  This acts as a call to action to encourage the site user to submit their details to arrange a callback.

## Credits
----

* I used very similar code for my home page, nav bar and footer as taught in the 'Love Running Walkthrough Project' on the [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Web Development course.  I did change some styling , but ultimately I was aiming for a simliar layout for my main page and navigation links/footer and this code helped me to get my project off to a good start.

* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) has been an invaluable resource and I have read many articles relating to positioning, styling my contact form (which gave me a bit of headache to be honest!!)

* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Again a valuable resource for consolidating what I had already learned and finding out more about HTML and CSS properties.

* [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) - I used this website to select a color pallete, I started with a natural dark brown similar to that of the wood in the banner image and used that to generate a pallette of complementing colors.  From a selection of palettes generated, I chose the 'Classy Palette'

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 

* [Google](http://google.com)

* [Online Convert](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-webp) - used to convert images from jpeg to webp for better performance

* Pip Southgate - for providing all images and content for the website (permissions receieved from any wedding photographers and former-clients to use images).
